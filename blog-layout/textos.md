# My trip to Amsterdam

Amsterdam is one of my favourite cities. After spending a week there, I feel like I’ve found a home away from Paris (I’m sorry London but you just don’t cut it in terms of prettiness). And boy I have so much to tell you about my time there!

Before heading to the Dutch capital, I did a lot of research, reading a pocket guidebook cover to cover and receiving a few recommendations for places to go. In truth I don’t think I’ve been more excited about a holiday: it was the first city break my boyfriend and I have been on, and after almost a year of working solidly, a week away was so appealing.
